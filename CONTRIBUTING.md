# Contributing guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We greatly value the feedback and contributions from our
community, whether it's a bug report, a new feature, a correction, or additional documentation.

Before submitting any issues or pull requests, please read through this document to ensure that we have all the
necessary information to respond effectively to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting security issues

We take all security reports extremely seriously. When we receive such reports, we will promptly investigate and address
any potential vulnerabilities.

If you discover a potential security issue in this project, please notify AWS/Amazon Security through one of the
following channels:

- Submit a report via our [vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/).
- Send an email directly to [AWS Security](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).

> [!CAUTION]
> Do **not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This helps ensure the issue can be addressed
> without exposing sensitive details.

We appreciate you taking the time to responsibly disclose any security concerns. Your contribution helps us improve the
security of this project and protect our users.

## Reporting bugs and feature requests

You are welcome to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or request new features. When submitting an issue, please
check if the problem has already been reported in existing open or recently closed issues. Provide as much information
as possible, such as:

* A reproducible test case or steps to reproduce the issue;
* The version of the code you are using;
* Any relevant changes you have made;
* Details about your environment or deployment.

## Contributing via pull requests

Contributions via pull requests are greatly appreciated. Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You have checked for any existing open or recently merged pull requests that may cover the same problem.
3. If you are working on a significant change, please open an issue to discuss it beforehand.

To submit a pull request:

1. Fork the repository;
2. Modify the source, focusing on the specific change you are contributing. Avoid reformatting the entire codebase, as
   it will make it harder for us to review your changes;
3. Ensure that the local tests pass;
4. Commit your changes to your fork using clear commit messages;
5. Submit a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface;
6. Monitor the pull request for any automated CI failures and stay involved in the conversation.

For more information on forking a repository and creating a pull request, refer to the GitHub documentation
on [forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
and [creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Finding contributions to work on

Browsing the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute to. Look for issues labeled as "help wanted"
to find tasks that are good starting points.
