This repository contains templates for common open-source project files.

As a maintainer or contributor to an AWS Labs project, you're welcome to use and adapt these templates to suit your
needs. In many cases, simply copying and pasting the templates should be sufficient.

> [!NOTE]
> This README file is not part of the templates, as the README for each project should be highly project-specific and
> personalized. For some tips on how to write a good README, visit https://www.makeareadme.com/ (for instance).
