# Reporting security issues

We take all security reports extremely seriously. When we receive such reports, we will promptly investigate and address
any potential vulnerabilities.

If you discover a potential security issue in this project, please notify AWS/Amazon Security through one of the
following channels:

- Submit a report via our [vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/).
- Send an email directly to [AWS Security](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).

> [!CAUTION]
> Do **not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This helps ensure the issue can be addressed
> without exposing sensitive details.

We appreciate you taking the time to responsibly disclose any security concerns. Your contribution helps us improve the
security of this project and protect our users.
